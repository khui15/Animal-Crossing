# Wargames?

Next semester, I will be doing another security course! I've read the course outline and there will be a lot of CTFs (yay!) so to prepare myself, I've decided to set aside a time everyday where I will do some capturing of flags.

I've decided to reattempt the OverTheWire Bandit CTF and blog about what I've learnt because I'm not _comfortable_ with CLI. I know basic commands but I'll need to know more than `cd` to comfortably capture flags.

I've decided to document the commands I've learnt so that I can look back and see how far I've come, and so that I'll be able to use these blogs as reference in case I forget.

## cat
Concatenate files and print on the standard output.

## find
* -type what type of file you want
* -size of the file you're looking for
* -executable if you're looking for an executible file
* -user name of the user
* -group name of the group
