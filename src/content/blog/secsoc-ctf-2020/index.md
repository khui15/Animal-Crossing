# Team A BANANA!

My friend (z5206677) and I (yeet) decided to participate in a CTF held by CSESoc and SecSoc. Despite only being a team of two, and starting one and a half later than the top 10 teams, we managed to secure first place! It was a great experience as, unlike the previous CTF I participated in, I now had a basic understanding of the different kinds of exploits. Roproproproprop.

I decided to place my write-up on Github, which can be found [here](https://github.com/eutojo/SecSocCTF2020), alongside the relevant code used to perform the exploits. My partner in crime, [featherbear](https://featherbear.cc/blog/post/csesoc-secsoc-ctf-2020/), has also blessed us with a writeup.

# Overall thoughts...

I thought the CTF was a lot of fun! The challenges had a lot of variety, from needing to read the comments on a page, to overriding canaries. 

It made me realise the things I liked, and the things I didn't like. For example, I didn't like recon challenges. This is surprising as I enjoy doing 'research'. But this may be because I restricted myself to looking at the one given website, and didn't think to venture off to the other sites mentioned to continue my reconaissance. I did, however, enjoy the binary challenges. But this could be because I generally enjoy low-level things, and I've been drilled to perform weekly wargames. I've been pavloved into enjoying obtaining flags from  binary exploits.

The CTF also let me take a step back and realise my progress. This time last year, I honestly didn't even understand what buffer overflows were, or how to take advantage of them and I didn't know what Binary Ninja was, and thought that x86 was confusing, even though I know MIPS and AVR Assembly. I also did not know any SQL, making SQL injections a mystery, nor did I really undestand cyphers such as Caesar cyphers and Vigenere cyphers. Damn. You really do learn a lot in a year.

CTFs are a fun way to test your toolkit. I'm going to start keeping track of useful websites, repositories, libraries, and the like, such that I'll become more and more prepared for CTFs. It's a shame that this is my final year, meaning that I may not even be able to participate in anymore SecSoc CTFs... but hey, I guess that just means I have to participate in other CTFs and attempt much harder challenges.

I hope [featherbear](https://featherbear.cc/) remains my CTF partner and that we'd be able to keep track of our successes and stories. Like how last year we came 7th and thought that was an amazing achievement (there's a blogpost written about it [here](https://public-insecurities.tumblr.com/post/186421557735/secsoc-term-2-ctf), which is continued on [here](https://public-insecurities.tumblr.com/post/186557165880/ctf-solutions-workshop)). And how this year, I was wondering for the longest time why my function was taking 39 as an argument, when I was feeding it 57... (0x39 -> 57).

Here's to more CTFs in the future!
