# Overall thoughts...

Well, I honestly think that making the exam open book did not ease the level of difficulty as I can agree with the lecturer that the exam really tested your understanding. It was similar to elec-type exams where you're taught the theory in class and then apply that theory in tutorials and exams. However, unlike elec courses, the tutorial questions were quite limited in terms of what we're tested so we weren't given a lot of practice material. That being said, I don't think that the exam was _too_ difficult.
