As with many other games such as Terraria, Stardew Valley and Harvest Moon, my favourite activity is fishing. I can spend hours just fishing - collecting clams, making bait, collecting fish. However, I realised that I was tired of having to look at the Animal Crossing Wiki to try and figure out what fish are available and when... thus, I created <a href=\"https://animal-crossing-catches.eunike.dev\">this</a> website.</p>\n<p>There are existing alternatives which allow users to figure out what fish are available, such as the <a href=\"https://animalcrossing.fandom.com/wiki/Fish_(New_Horizons)#Southern%20Hemisphere\">Animal Crossing Wiki</a> itself and this <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Wm5wZov6PIVCX5lYsipK6DQJrh_tdTH92z1jJSzv5Bo/edit#gid=54869885\">Google Sheets compilation</a>. However, I wanted something low effort for my lazy soul and I also wanted to have some fun creating it. My React skills were getting a little rusty as well, so this was the perfect mini project.</p>\n<h2>The Project</h2>\n<p>So there were three main features I wanted on the site.</p>\n<p><strong>#1 Available Now</strong> </p>\n<p>I wanted something which showed me what fish and bugs were available at the current time so that I did not waste my time grinding a fish that wasn't even available.</p>\n<p><strong>#2 Available This Season</strong></p>\n<p>I also wanted to know what fish/bugs were available this season, just so that I did not get my hopes up waiting for a fish that would never even appear until 6 months.</p>\n<p><strong>#3 Best Time</strong></p>\n<p>The last feature I wanted would be the ability to search what the best time would be to catch each fish. This would be especially important if I wanted to catch a fish which had a very common size.</p>\n<h2>The Data</h2>\n<p>Since I knew what features I wanted, the next problem would be how I would store the data. JSON objects were the first thing that came to mind, but obtaining those JSON objects were another problem on its own. I ended up recruiting the help of my partner to scrape the data off the fish Wiki for me.</p>\n<p>He then gave me the script so that I would be able to learn from it and adjust it depending on what I'd like to change as the project progressed. </p>\n<h2>Deployment</h2>\n<p>Once I was ready to deploy a basic version of the site, I realised that Github Pages did not like Browser Router. Another solution would be to use Hash Router, but for some reason that did not work for me either. Thus, I moved onto Netlify! I actually enjoy it a bit more than Github as it actually shows you the progress of your deployment so I didn't have to keep refreshing and waiting to see if the page was broken or if it just wasn't ready yet. I considered deploying on AWS but that seems a bit overkill for this small project.</p>\n<h2>The Result</h2>\n<p>Now I have both a vision and the data... so BAM website created. Well the basic foundations of it anyway. I can't wait to see how it'll grow over time.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"09 April, 2019","title":"Animal Crossing Project","featuredImage":{"childImageSharp":{"sizes":{"base64":"data:image/jpeg;base64,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","aspectRatio":1.7752808988764044,"src":"/static/b25e441550e4729288d41d66c7bec954/aac8d/hero_image.jpg","srcSet":"/static/b25e441550e4729288d41d66c7bec954/426bb/hero_image.jpg 158w,\n/static/b25e441550e4729288d41d66c7bec954/6544a/hero_image.jpg 315w,\n/static/b25e441550e4729288d41d66c7bec954/aac8d/hero_image.jpg 630w,\n/static/b25e441550e4729288d41d66c7bec954/631d7/hero_image.jpg 945w,\n/static/b25e441550e4729288d41d66c7bec954/9c1fb/hero_image.jpg 1260w,\n/static/b25e441550e4729288d41d66c7bec954/ec6c5/hero_image.jpg 1280w","sizes":"(max-width: 630px) 100vw, 630px"}}}}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/animal-crossing-project/"}}}
