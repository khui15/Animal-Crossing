It is thought of as outdated and disgusting. Regardless, most of the web still run on PHP. Wordpress also uses PHP, so after this course, you're basically on your way to becoming a PHP developer.</p>\n<p>I for one believe that most people hate PHP because:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Its the stereotype to hate PHP.</li>\n<li>They've never tried PHP.</li>\n</ol>\n<h1>PHP crash course</h1>\n<p>PHP files are defined within a special PHP tag:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-PHP\">&#x3C;?php\n    PHP stuff goes here :)\n?>\n</code></pre>\n<p>Inside these tags, you can put in many things.</p>\n<h2>Variables</h2>\n<p>Variables in PHP are defined by using the <code>$</code> symbol.</p>\n<p>You can perform operations on numbers:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-PHP\">  &#x3C;?php\n    $x = 5;\n    $y = 10\n    $z = $x + $y\n  ?>\n</code></pre>\n<p>You can also perform string contantenation. Unlike JavaScript, concatenation is done using the <code>.</code> symbol.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-PHP\">  &#x3C;?php\n    $x = 'Hello ';\n    $y = 'World';\n    $z = $x . $y\n  ?>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Echo</h2>\n<p>There is a special... thing... called <code>echo</code>. It is known as a construct and prints out whatever follows it into the document as text.</p>\n<p>As such, you're able to use it to write whole HTML and JavaScript documents.</p>\n<p><em>eg</em>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-PHP\">&#x3C;?php\n    $x = 5;\n    $y = 10\n  echo ($x + $y)\n?>\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code class=\"language-PHP\">&#x3C;?php\n  echo \"&#x3C;h1>hello world&#x3C;/h1>\"\n?>\n</code></pre>\n<h2>Syntax</h2>\n<h3>Quotation marks</h3>\n<p>When using quotation marks within commands, ensure that you either:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Use double quotation marks to mark the contents of the echo and single quotation marks within the contents, or vice versa.</li>\n<li>Escape the contents of the echo by prepending a backslash prior to the symbol. This will tell echo that the symbol is part data and not part of the command.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Operators</h3>\n<h3>Comments</h3>","frontmatter":{"date":"14 September, 2020","title":"BIOM9450 - PHP","featuredImage":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/biom9450-php/"}}}
